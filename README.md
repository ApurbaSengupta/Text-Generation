# Text-Generation

Developing a LSTM-based deep neural language model to generate text sequences character-by-character, given a context sequence of text.

Utilizing few English novels for training and evaluating the model.

Utilizing PyTorch framework for development. Using a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti GPU machine to facilitate training of the model.
